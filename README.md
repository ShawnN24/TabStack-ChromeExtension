**TabStack** is a Chrome extension that lets you save, view, and manage groups of browser tabs ("tab stacks") for easy retrieval later. Quickly save your current open tabs as a named stack, reopen saved stacks, and keep your browsing organized.

## Features

- View saved TabStacks with their tab titles and favicons.
- Reopen all tabs in a saved TabStack with one click.
- Remove saved TabStacks.
- Keyboard shortcut support to save tabs quickly (default: `Ctrl+Shift+Z`).
- Prevent duplicate stack names.
- Clean, minimal popup UI for easy interaction.
